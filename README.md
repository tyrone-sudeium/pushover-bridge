# Pushover Bridge

Just a stupid thing I run inside my [tailnet](https://tailscale.com) that allows me to 
queue up push notifications to be delivered to my Apple Watch via [Pushover](https://pushover.net).

# Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- A tailnet, since you definitely do not want this thing on the public internet
